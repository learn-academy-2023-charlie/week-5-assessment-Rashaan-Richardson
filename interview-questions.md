## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations:

Model validation refers to the process of confirming that the model actually achieves its intended purpose. In most situations, this will involve confirmation that the model is predictive under the conditions of its intended use.

2. RESTful routes:

A RESTful route is a route that provides a mapping of HTTP verbs ( get , post , put , patch , delete ) to the CRUD actions ( create , read , update, delete ) that are defined in our controllers

3. ERB:

ERB (or Ruby code generated by ERB) returns a string in the same character encoding as the input string. When the input string has a magic comment, however, it returns a string in the encoding specified by the magic comment.

4. Params:

By using the params keyword, you can specify a method parameter that takes a variable number of arguments. The parameter type must be a single-dimensional array. No additional parameters are permitted after the params keyword in a method declaration, and only one params keyword is permitted in a method declaration.

5. API:

API is the acronym for application programming interface â€” a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.
